# Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on input data without explicit output labels. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms are trained only on input data, and the model must learn to find meaningful patterns in the data without any guidance or feedback from the output labels.

Unsupervised learning can be useful in a variety of settings, such as exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and anomaly detection. [Clustering algorithms](https://github.com/SeventhPrize/INDE_577_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Unsupervised%20learning/Clustering.ipynb) can group similar data points together based on their similarity, while [dimensionality reduction techniques](https://github.com/SeventhPrize/INDE_577_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Unsupervised%20learning/PrincipalComponentAnalysis.ipynb) can reduce the number of input variables while preserving the important features of the data.
