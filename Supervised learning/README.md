# Supervised machine learning
Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model on labeled data, where the input data is paired with the corresponding output or response variable. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables, so that the model can predict the response variable of new, unseen input data.

Supervised learning is useful in a variety of applications where the goal is to use data to make a prediction, such as image classification, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. It is particularly powerful when the input-output relationship is complex or nonlinear, and the model needs to capture intricate patterns in the data to make accurate predictions.

We explore [parametric models](https://github.com/SeventhPrize/INDE_577_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning/tree/main/Supervised%20learning/Parametric%20models) and [nonparametric models](https://github.com/SeventhPrize/INDE_577_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning/tree/main/Supervised%20learning/Nonparametric%20models). Parametric models assume that the input data is generated by a known probability distribution, and that the model has a fixed number of parameters that can be estimated from the data. Examples of parametric models include regression neural networks. These models typically make strong assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, and their performance can be limited if the data does not conform to these assumptions.

Nonparametric models, on the other hand, make few assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, and can be more flexible in modeling complex relationships between the input and output variables. These models do not have a fixed number of parameters, and instead rely on the data to determine the complexity of the model. Examples of nonparametric models include decision trees and random forests.
