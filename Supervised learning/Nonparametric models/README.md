# Nonparametric Models

Nonparametric models are a type of supervised machine learning model that makes few assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, and can be more flexible in modeling complex relationships between the input and output variables. Nonparametric models do not have a fixed number of parameters, and instead rely on the data to determine the complexity of the model.

One popular nonparametric model is the [decision trees](https://github.com/SeventhPrize/INDE_577_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Supervised%20learning/Nonparametric%20models/DecisionTree.ipynb). A decision tree is a hierarchical model that partitions the input space into smaller and smaller subsets, based on a series of binary decisions that are made at each node of the tree. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on one of the input variables, and each leaf node represents a predicted output value.

A common extension of the decision tree is the random forest, where several decision trees are aggregated together to make stronger predictions. We explore random forests, and other [ensemble methods](https://github.com/SeventhPrize/INDE_577_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Supervised%20learning/Nonparametric%20models/EnsembleMethods.ipynb).
