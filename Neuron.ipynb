    "# Neuron models\n",
    "Neuron models are featured heavily in machine learning as a way to convert data signals into some quantitative output. Neuron models are an algorithmic representation of biological neuron cells like those found in the human brain. Biological neurons are composed of dendrites, a cell body, and an axon. Chemical signals are received by the dendrites, creating an electrical potential in the neuron. If the electrical potential exceeds the threshold of a certain activation potential, then an electrical impulse is sent through the axon, which releases chemical signals to other neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm neuron models behave analogously. Instead of a chemical signal, a data signal--typically a vector--is received by the neuron. If the data signal produces a strong enough preactivation value, then the neuron produces an output value to the next neurons."

    "## Single-neuron models\n",
    "The simplest neural network model is the single-neuron model. A neuron is defined by a set of \"preactivation weights\" $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, a \"bias\" $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and an \"activation function\" $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{m+1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. The model accepts a signal vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$. The preactivation function $w \\cdot x + b$ is computed. Then, the postactivation value $\\hat y = \\phi(w \\cdot x + b)$ is output by the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neuron may be trained using an update method, which changes the neuron weights $w$ such that the neuron outputs become more optimal. There are many ways to update the weights and many ways to measure the optimality of neuron outputs. Our below (abstract) implementation of a single-neuron model chooses to train the neuron using the following scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^m, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. These can be initialized randomly; we have chosen to initialize to all 0s.\n",
    "2. Repeat for a given number of epochs: Foreach data point $i$ composed of input signal $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ and observation $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n",
    "    1. Make model prediction $\\hat y_i = \\phi(w \\cdot x_i + b)$.\n",
    "    2. Update the weights $w, b$ using the input signal $x_i$, observation $y_i$, and prediction $\\hat y_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have left the update method and the activation function as abstracted methods, as these methods will vary depending on neuron implementation and application."
