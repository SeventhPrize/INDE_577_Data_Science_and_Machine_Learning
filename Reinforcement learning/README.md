# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning to interact with an environment to achieve a specific goal. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled examples, and unsupervised learning, where the model is trained on unlabeled data, reinforcement learning involves learning from interactions with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

Applications of reinforcement learning include robotics, game playing, and autonomous vehicles, where the agent must learn to navigate a complex environment and make decisions in real-time to achieve a specific goal. We implement the [k-armed bandit model]((https://github.com/SeventhPrize/INDE_577_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Reinforcement%20learning/KArmedBandit.ipynb)), one of the simplest reinforcement learning problems that involves finding the optimal strategy for selecting actions with unknown reward distributions.
